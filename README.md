# Object Detection in Fridge for Real-Time Inventory Management

This project focuses on utilizing object detection techniques to monitor the contents of a fridge in real-time, enabling efficient inventory management for stores or households. By deploying computer vision algorithms, the system can accurately detect and classify objects inside the fridge, providing insights into the current inventory status. This solution greatly enhances store management by automating the inventory tracking process, optimizing restocking procedures, and minimizing waste due to expired or unused items.

# Key Features:

Real-time object detection: The system continuously monitors the contents of the fridge and detects objects as they are added or removed.
Classification of objects: It classifies detected objects to provide detailed insights into the types of items present in the fridge.
Inventory tracking: Enables accurate tracking of inventory levels, helping store managers or homeowners make informed decisions about restocking and usage.
Alerts and notifications: Provides alerts for low-stock items or potential issues such as expired products, enabling timely action to be taken.
User-friendly interface: Offers an intuitive interface for easy monitoring and management of fridge inventory.

# How it Works:

Object Detection: The system uses computer vision algorithms to detect objects within the fridge using a live video feed.

Object Classification: Detected objects are classified into categories such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, beverages, etc., using machine learning models.

Inventory Tracking: The system maintains a real-time inventory database, updating it as objects are added or removed from the fridge.

Alerts and Notifications: Alerts are generated for low-stock items or potential issues such as expired products, ensuring timely action can be taken.

# Benefits:

Efficient Inventory Management: Automates the inventory tracking process, saving time and effort.
Reduced Waste: Helps minimize waste by alerting users to expired or unused items.
Improved Customer Experience: Ensures that popular items are always in stock, enhancing customer satisfaction.
Cost Savings: Optimizes inventory levels, reducing excess stock and associated costs.

# Future Enhancements:

Integration with smart refrigerators for seamless data collection and analysis.
Enhanced object recognition capabilities for more accurate classification.
Implementation of predictive analytics for proactive inventory management.
